### Server Performance Statistics Script
[Project Link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats)

#### Overview
The `server-stats.sh` script is a comprehensive server monitoring tool that provides real-time information about various system metrics. This script is designed to work on any Linux server and provides detailed insights into system performance, resource usage, and system status.

#### Features
The script provides the following information:

1. **System Information**
   - Operating System Version
   - Kernel Version
   - Hostname
   - System Uptime
   - Load Average
   - Number of Logged-in Users
   - Failed Login Attempts

2. **CPU Information**
   - Total CPU Usage (percentage)
   - Number of CPU Cores
   - CPU Model Details

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Total Memory
   - Used Memory
   - Free Memory
   - Memory Usage Percentage

4. **Disk Usage**
   - Total Disk Space
   - Used Disk Space
   - Free Disk Space
   - Disk Usage Percentage

5. **Process Information**
   - Top 5 CPU-consuming Processes
   - Top 5 Memory-consuming Processes

6. **Network Information**
   - System IP Addresses (excluding localhost)

7. **System Load**
   - 1-minute Load Average
   - 5-minute Load Average
   - 15-minute Load Average

8. **Swap Usage**
   - Total Swap Space
   - Used Swap Space
   - Free Swap Space

#### Prerequisites
- Linux Operating System
- Basic system utilities (top, free, df, ps, etc.)
- Bash shell

#### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x server-stats.sh
   ```

#### Usage
Run the script using:
```bash
./server-stats.sh
```

### Log Archive Tool
[Project Link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool)

#### Overview
A command-line tool designed to archive logs by compressing them and storing them in a new directory. This tool helps maintain system cleanliness while preserving logs in a compressed format for future reference.

#### Features
- Compress logs into tar.gz format
- Timestamp-based archive naming
- Archive history logging
- Directory existence validation
- Archive size reporting

#### Prerequisites
- Linux/Unix-based system
- Bash shell
- Basic system utilities (tar, date, du)

#### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x log-archive.sh
   ```

#### Usage
Run the script with a log directory as an argument:
```bash
./log-archive.sh <log-directory>
```

Example:
```bash
./log-archive.sh /var/log
```

#### Output
- Creates a `logs_archive` directory
- Generates timestamped archives (e.g., `logs_archive_20240816_100648.tar.gz`)
- Maintains an `archive_history.log` file with archive creation records
- Displays archive size and status

#### Notes
- The script requires read permissions for the log directory
- Archives are stored in a `logs_archive` directory in the current working directory
- Each archive operation is logged in `archive_history.log`

### Technical Details
The script uses various Linux commands and utilities:
- `top`: For CPU usage information
- `free`: For memory and swap usage
- `df`: For disk usage information
- `ps`: For process information
- `ip`: For network information
- `cat /proc/loadavg`: For system load information
- `uname`: For system information
- `who`: For user information
- `lastb`: For failed login attempts

### Notes
- The script requires root privileges for some information (like failed login attempts)
- Some information might vary depending on the Linux distribution
- The script is designed to be lightweight and can be run frequently without significant system impact

### Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Historical data tracking
- Alert thresholds for critical metrics
- Export functionality for data analysis
- Web interface for remote monitoring
- Custom metric collection based on user needs

### Nginx Log Analyzer
[Project Link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/nginx-log-analyser)

#### Overview
A command-line tool designed to analyze Nginx access logs and provide various statistics about requests, IPs, and response codes. This tool helps in understanding web server traffic patterns and identifying potential issues.

#### Features
- Top 5 IP addresses with the most requests
- Top 5 most requested paths
- Top 5 response status codes
- Top 5 user agents
- Additional statistics:
  - Total number of requests
  - Total unique IPs
  - Total unique paths
  - Total unique user agents
- Response code distribution

#### Prerequisites
- Linux/Unix-based system
- Bash shell
- Basic system utilities (awk, sort, uniq, head)

#### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x nginx-log-analyzer.sh
   ```

#### Usage
Run the script with a log file as an argument:
```bash
./nginx-log-analyzer.sh <log-file>
```

Example:
```bash
./nginx-log-analyzer.sh /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

#### Output Format
The script provides color-coded output:
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Section headers
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Statistics and results
- ðŸ”´ Red: Error messages

#### Technical Details
The script uses various Unix commands:
- `awk`: For text processing and field extraction
- `sort`: For sorting data
- `uniq`: For counting unique occurrences
- `head`: For limiting output to top 5
- `wc`: For counting lines and unique entries
