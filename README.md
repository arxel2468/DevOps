```bash
./server-stats.sh
```

### Log Archive Tool
[Project Link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool)

#### Overview
A command-line tool designed to archive logs by compressing them and storing them in a new directory. This tool helps maintain system cleanliness while preserving logs in a compressed format for future reference.

#### Features
- Compress logs into tar.gz format
- Timestamp-based archive naming
- Archive history logging
- Directory existence validation
- Archive size reporting

#### Prerequisites
- Linux/Unix-based system
- Bash shell
- Basic system utilities (tar, date, du)

#### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x log-archive.sh
   ```

#### Usage
Run the script with a log directory as an argument:
```bash
./log-archive.sh <log-directory>
```

Example:
```bash
./log-archive.sh /var/log
```

#### Output
- Creates a `logs_archive` directory
- Generates timestamped archives (e.g., `logs_archive_20240816_100648.tar.gz`)
- Maintains an `archive_history.log` file with archive creation records
- Displays archive size and status

#### Notes
- The script requires read permissions for the log directory
- Archives are stored in a `logs_archive` directory in the current working directory
- Each archive operation is logged in `archive_history.log`

### Technical Details
The script uses various Linux commands and utilities:
- `top`: For CPU usage information
- `free`: For memory and swap usage
- `df`: For disk usage information
- `ps`: For process information
- `ip`: For network information
- `cat /proc/loadavg`: For system load information
- `uname`: For system information
- `who`: For user information
- `lastb`: For failed login attempts

### Notes
- The script requires root privileges for some information (like failed login attempts)
- Some information might vary depending on the Linux distribution
- The script is designed to be lightweight and can be run frequently without significant system impact

### Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Historical data tracking
- Alert thresholds for critical metrics
- Export functionality for data analysis
- Web interface for remote monitoring
- Custom metric collection based on user needs

### Nginx Log Analyzer
[Project Link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/nginx-log-analyser)

#### Overview

#### Features
- Top 5 IP addresses with the most requests
- Top 5 most requested paths
- Top 5 response status codes
- Top 5 user agents
- Additional statistics:
  - Total number of requests
  - Total unique IPs
  - Total unique paths
  - Total unique user agents
- Response code distribution

#### Prerequisites
- Linux/Unix-based system
- Bash shell
- Basic system utilities (awk, sort, uniq, head)

#### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x nginx-log-analyzer.sh
   ```

#### Usage
Run the script with a log file as an argument:
```bash
./nginx-log-analyzer.sh <log-file>
```

Example:
```bash
./nginx-log-analyzer.sh /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

#### Output Format
The script provides color-coded output:
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Section headers
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Statistics and results
- ðŸ”´ Red: Error messages

#### Technical Details
The script uses various Unix commands:
- `awk`: For text processing and field extraction
- `sort`: For sorting data
- `uniq`: For counting unique occurrences
- `head`: For limiting output to top 5
- `wc`: For counting lines and unique entries

### GitHub Pages Deployment
[Project Link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow)

#### Overview
A GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys a static website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are made to the index.html file. This project demonstrates continuous deployment using GitHub's built-in CI/CD capabilities.

#### Features
- Automated deployment to GitHub Pages
- Path-specific triggering (only deploys when index.html changes)
- Simple static website showcase
- Demonstration of GitHub Actions workflow

#### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Repository with GitHub Pages enabled
- Basic understanding of YAML and GitHub Actions

#### Implementation Details
The project consists of three main components:

1. **Static Website (index.html)**
   - A simple HTML page that displays information about the DevOps projects
   - Styled with CSS for better presentation
   - Contains a list of the projects in this repository

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/static.yml)**
   - Triggered only when changes to index.html are pushed to the main branch
   - Sets up the necessary environment for deployment
   - Builds the site by copying files to the _site directory
   - Deploys the built site to GitHub Pages

3. **Repository Configuration**
   - GitHub repository needs to have Pages enabled
   - Permissions for GitHub Actions to deploy Pages

#### How It Works
1. When a change is pushed to the index.html file in the main branch, the workflow is triggered
2. The workflow checks out the repository contents
3. It sets up Node.js and other dependencies
4. It prepares the site by copying files to a build directory
5. Finally, it deploys the built site to GitHub Pages

#### Viewing the Deployed Site
Once deployed, the site can be viewed at: https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/

#### Notes
- The first deployment may take a few minutes to become available
- GitHub Pages deployment requires the repository to have GitHub Pages enabled in the settings
- The workflow requires appropriate permissions to deploy to GitHub Pages

#### Future Enhancements
- Add a custom domain
- Implement a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo
- Add more interactive features to the website
- Implement testing before deployment

1. How to generate SSH keys
2. How to connect to a remote server
3. How to add keys to the server
4. How to configure the SSH client
